1. What was your goal for this deliverable, as defined on your Learning Plan?
My goal was to completely understand what databases were and hey they worked, alongside how to set them up in a way to store data.

2. Did you meet this goal? If not, why?
I did meet this goal

3. What needs to happen for you to stay on schedule from this point forward (e.g., change of plan, putting in extra time, getting help, etc.)?
next I need to learn how to design a user interface using code and not just designing it by hand.

4. Paste your current, accurate learning plan below.

Date|semester Milestone|Project Milestone
----|------------------|------------------
Sun 02 21|Deliverable 1: new learning|What is home automation What are the components required to have a fully functioning home automation system
Sun 03-07|Deliverable 2: new learning|Learn what a database is: How it functions and what’s required to make it run smoothly. Learn how to set one up
Sun 03-28|Deliverable 3: project foundation or new learning|How to design an intuitive user interface that is easy to use.Learn how to set up a signup/login window to allow access to different users.
Sun 04-11|Deliverable 4: adding features & debugging| Integrate a user interface with a database of stored values for the different features in the program like,lighting, thermostat, and shutters. AAlso going to run multiple tests to see whether or not the database, save function, sign-in function, and delete functions are all working together. Tests will be done by making multiple different users and entering different values for each of the different fields.
Thu 05-06|Deliverable 5: using feedback to improve/debug|Create a simple program that takes the saved data and exports it to a connected raspberry pi which then executes the different functions such as turning on the thermostat at a certain time and having it be a certain temperature, turning the lights on and off at set times, and lowering and raising the shutters after sunset and after sunrise.

Just doing the hello world tutorial again.
A program that controls a houses lights thermostat and automatic window shutters based on user inputs through a simple interface.
